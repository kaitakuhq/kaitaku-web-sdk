# Install (or npm install)
yarn

### Build

There are mainly 2 output targets:

1. browser - This creates a already compiled code which can run in a browser. Ideal for running with VanillaJS and jQuery.

2. module - This creates a library so that UI frameworks can import it before compiling. Ideal for running in React, Angular, Vue.js and many more.
